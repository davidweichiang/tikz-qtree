# tikz-qtree

Version 1.2 (20 Apr 2012)

This package provides a macro for drawing trees with TikZ using the
easy syntax of Alexis Dimitriadis'
[Qtree](https://ctan.org/pkg/qtree). It improves on TikZ's standard
tree-drawing facility by laying out tree nodes without collisions, and
it improves on Qtree by adding lots of features from TikZ (for
example, edge labels, arrows between nodes).

Please see tikz-qtree-manual.pdf for instructions and examples.
